#' Fit an SGS model using k-fold cross-validation.
#'
#' Function to fit a pathwise solution of sparse-group SLOPE (SGS) models using k-fold cross-validation. Supports both linear and logistic regression, both with dense and sparse matrix implementations.
#'
#' Fits SGS models under a pathwise solution using adaptive three operator splitting (ATOS), picking the 1se model as optimum. Warm starts are implemented.
#'
#' @param X Input matrix of dimensions \eqn{n \times p}{n*p}. Can be a sparse matrix (using class \code{"sparseMatrix"} from the \code{Matrix} package).
#' @param y Output vector of dimension \eqn{n}. For \code{type="linear"} should be continuous and for \code{type="logistic"} should be a binary variable.
#' @param groups A grouping structure for the input data. Should take the form of a vector of group indices.
#' @param type The type of regression to perform. Supported values are: \code{"linear"} and \code{"logistic"}.
#' @param lambda The regularisation parameter. Defines the level of sparsity in the model. A higher value leads to sparser models: 
#'   - \code{"path"} computes a path of regularisation parameters of length \code{"path_length"}. The path will begin just above the value at which the first predictor enters the model and will terminate at the value determined by \code{"min_frac"}.
#'   - User-specified single value or sequence. Internal scaling is applied based on the type of standardisation. The returned \code{"lambda"} value will be the original unscaled value(s).
#' @param path_length The number of \eqn{\lambda} values to fit the model for. If \code{"lambda"} is user-specified, this is ignored.
#' @param min_frac Smallest value of \eqn{\lambda} as a fraction of the maximum value. That is, the final \eqn{\lambda} will be \code{"min_frac"} of the first \eqn{\lambda} value.
#' @param alpha The value of \eqn{\alpha}, which defines the convex balance between SLOPE and gSLOPE. Must be between 0 and 1. Recommended value is 0.95.
#' @param vFDR Defines the desired variable false discovery rate (FDR) level, which determines the shape of the variable penalties. Must be between 0 and 1.
#' @param gFDR Defines the desired group false discovery rate (FDR) level, which determines the shape of the group penalties. Must be between 0 and 1.
#' @param pen_method The type of penalty sequences to use (see Feser and Evangelou (2023)):
#'   - \code{"1"} uses the vMean SGS and gMean gSLOPE sequences. 
#'   - \code{"2"} uses the vMax SGS and gMean gSLOPE sequences.
#'   - \code{"3"} uses the BH SLOPE and gMean gSLOPE sequences, also known as SGS Original.
#' @param nfolds The number of folds to use in cross-validation.
#' @param max_iter Maximum number of ATOS iterations to perform. 
#' @param backtracking The backtracking parameter, \eqn{\tau}, as defined in Pedregosa and Gidel (2018).
#' @param max_iter_backtracking Maximum number of backtracking line search iterations to perform per global iteration.
#' @param tol Convergence tolerance for the stopping criteria.
#' @param standardise Type of standardisation to perform on \code{X}: 
#'   - \code{"l2"} standardises the input data to have \eqn{\ell_2} norms of one.
#'   - \code{"l1"} standardises the input data to have \eqn{\ell_1} norms of one.
#'   - \code{"sd"} standardises the input data to have standard deviation of one.
#'   - \code{"none"} no standardisation applied.
#' @param intercept Logical flag for whether to fit an intercept.
#' @param error_criteria The criteria used to discriminate between models along the path. Supported values are: \code{"mse"} (mean squared error) and \code{"mae"} (mean absolute error).
#' @param screen Logical flag for whether to apply screening rules (see Feser and Evangelou (2024)). Screening discards irrelevant groups before fitting, greatly improving speed.
#' @param verbose Logical flag for whether to print fitting information.
#' @param v_weights Optional vector for the variable penalty weights. Overrides the penalties from pen_method if specified. When entering custom weights, these are multiplied internally by \eqn{\lambda} and \eqn{\alpha}. To void this behaviour, set \eqn{\lambda = 2} and \eqn{\alpha = 0.5}
#' @param w_weights Optional vector for the group penalty weights. Overrides the penalties from pen_method if specified. When entering custom weights, these are multiplied internally by \eqn{\lambda} and \eqn{1-\alpha}. To void this behaviour, set \eqn{\lambda = 2} and \eqn{\alpha = 0.5}
#' @param warm_start Optional list for implementing warm starts. These values are used as initial values in the fitting algorithm. Need to supply \code{"x"} and \code{"u"} in the form \code{"list(warm_x, warm_u)"}. Not recommended for use with a path or CV fit as start from the null model by design.
#'
#' @return A list containing:
#' \item{all_models}{A list of all the models fitted along the path.}
#' \item{fit}{The 1se chosen model, which is a \code{"sgs"} object type.}
#' \item{best_lambda}{The value of \eqn{\lambda} which generated the chosen model.}
#' \item{best_lambda_id}{The path index for the chosen model.}
#' \item{errors}{A table containing fitting information about the models on the path.}
#' \item{type}{Indicates which type of regression was performed.}
