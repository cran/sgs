#' Fit a gOSCAR model.
#' 
#' Group OSCAR (gOSCAR) main fitting function. Supports both linear and logistic regression, both with dense and sparse matrix implementations.
#' 
#' \code{fit_goscar()} fits a gOSCAR model (Feser and Evangelou (2024)) using adaptive three operator splitting (ATOS). gOSCAR uses the same model set-up as for gSLOPE, but with different weights (see Bao et al. (2020) and Feser and Evangelou (2024)).
#' The penalties are given by (for a group \eqn{g} with \eqn{m} groups):
#' \deqn{
#'  w_g = \sigma_1 + \sigma_3(m-g),
#' }
#' where
#' \deqn{
#'      \sigma_1 = d_i\|X^\intercal y\|_\infty, \; \sigma_3 = \sigma_1/m.
#' }
#' 
#' @param X Input matrix of dimensions \eqn{n \times p}{n*p}. Can be a sparse matrix (using class \code{"sparseMatrix"} from the \code{Matrix} package).
#' @param y Output vector of dimension \eqn{n}. For \code{type="linear"} should be continuous and for \code{type="logistic"} should be a binary variable.
#' @param groups A grouping structure for the input data. Should take the form of a vector of group indices.
#' @param type The type of regression to perform. Supported values are: \code{"linear"} and \code{"logistic"}.
#' @param lambda The regularisation parameter. Defines the level of sparsity in the model. A higher value leads to sparser models: 
#'   - \code{"path"} computes a path of regularisation parameters of length \code{"path_length"}. The path will begin just above the value at which the first predictor enters the model and will terminate at the value determined by \code{min_frac}.
#'   - User-specified single value or sequence. Internal scaling is applied based on the type of standardisation. The returned \code{"lambda"} value will be the original unscaled value(s).
#' @param path_length The number of \eqn{\lambda} values to fit the model for. If \code{"lambda"} is user-specified, this is ignored.
#' @param min_frac Smallest value of \eqn{\lambda} as a fraction of the maximum value. That is, the final \eqn{\lambda} will be \code{"min_frac"} of the first \eqn{\lambda} value.
#' @param max_iter Maximum number of ATOS iterations to perform. 
#' @param backtracking The backtracking parameter, \eqn{\tau}, as defined in Pedregosa and Gidel (2018).
#' @param max_iter_backtracking Maximum number of backtracking line search iterations to perform per global iteration.
#' @param tol Convergence tolerance for the stopping criteria.
#' @param standardise Type of standardisation to perform on \code{X}: 
#'   - \code{"l2"} standardises the input data to have \eqn{\ell_2} norms of one. When using this \code{"lambda"} is scaled internally by \eqn{1/\sqrt{n}}.
#'   - \code{"l1"} standardises the input data to have \eqn{\ell_1} norms of one. When using this \code{"lambda"} is scaled internally by \eqn{1/n}.
#'   - \code{"sd"} standardises the input data to have standard deviation of one.
#'   - \code{"none"} no standardisation applied.
#' @param intercept Logical flag for whether to fit an intercept.
#' @param screen Logical flag for whether to apply screening rules (see Feser and Evangelou (2024)). Screening discards irrelevant groups before fitting, greatly improving speed.
#' @param verbose Logical flag for whether to print fitting information.
#' @param w_weights Optional vector for the group penalty weights. Overrides the OSCAR penalties when specified. When entering custom weights, these are multiplied internally by \eqn{\lambda}. To void this behaviour, set \eqn{\lambda = 1}.
#' 
#' @return A list containing:
#' \item{beta}{The fitted values from the regression. Taken to be the more stable fit between \code{x} and \code{z}, which is usually the former. A filter is applied to remove very small values, where ATOS has not been able to shrink exactly to zero. Check this against \code{x} and \code{z}.}
#' \item{group_effects}{The group values from the regression. Taken by applying the \eqn{\ell_2} norm within each group on \code{beta}.}
#' \item{selected_var}{A list containing the indicies of the active/selected variables for each \code{"lambda"} value. Index 1 corresponds to the first column in X.}
#' \item{selected_grp}{A list containing the indicies of the active/selected groups for each \code{"lambda"} value. Index 1 corresponds to the first group in the \code{groups} vector.}
#' \item{num_it}{Number of iterations performed. If convergence is not reached, this will be \code{max_iter}.}
#' \item{success}{Logical flag indicating whether ATOS converged, according to \code{tol}.}
#' \item{certificate}{Final value of convergence criteria.}
#' \item{x}{The solution to the original problem (see Pedregosa and Gidel (2018)).}
#' \item{u}{The solution to the dual problem (see Pedregosa and Gidel (2018)).}
#' \item{z}{The updated values from applying the first proximal operator (see Pedregosa and Gidel (2018)).}
#' \item{screen_set}{List of groups that were kept after screening step for each \code{"lambda"} value. (corresponds to \eqn{\mathcal{S}} in Feser and Evangelou (2024)).}
#' \item{epsilon_set}{List of groups that were used for fitting after screening for each \code{"lambda"} value. (corresponds to \eqn{\mathcal{E}} in Feser and Evangelou (2024)).}
#' \item{kkt_violations}{List of groups that violated the KKT conditions each \code{"lambda"} value. (corresponds to \eqn{\mathcal{K}} in Feser and Evangelou (2024)).}
#' \item{pen_gslope}{Vector of the group penalty sequence.}
#' \item{screen}{Logical flag indicating whether screening was applied.}
#' \item{type}{Indicates which type of regression was performed.}
#' \item{intercept}{Logical flag indicating whether an intercept was fit.}
#' \item{standardise}{Type of standardisation used.}
#' \item{lambda}{Value(s) of \eqn{\lambda} used to fit the model.}
