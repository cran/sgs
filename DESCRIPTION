Description: Implementation of Sparse-group SLOPE (SGS) (Feser and Evangelou (2023) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2305.09467>) models. Linear and logistic regression models are supported, both of which can be fit using k-fold cross-validation. Dense and sparse input matrices are supported. In addition, a general adaptive three operator splitting (ATOS) implementation is provided. Group SLOPE (gSLOPE) (Brzyski et al. (2019) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1411269>) models are also implemented. Both gSLOPE and SGS are available with strong screening rules (Feser and Evangelou (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2405.15357>) for computational speed-up.
