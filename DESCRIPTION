Description: Implementation of Sparse-group SLOPE: Adaptive bi-level with FDR-control (Feser et al. (2023) <arXiv:2305.09467>). Linear and logistic regression models are supported, both of which can be fit using k-fold cross-validation. Dense and sparse input matrices are supported. In addition, a general adaptive three operator splitting (ATOS) implementation is provided.
