\title{generate penalty sequences for SGS}
\usage{
generate_penalties(gFDR, vFDR, pen_method, groups, alpha)
}
\arguments{
\item{gFDR}{Defines the desired group false discovery rate (FDR) level, which determines the shape of the group penalties.}

\item{vFDR}{Defines the desired variable false discovery rate (FDR) level, which determines the shape of the variable penalties.}

\item{pen_method}{The type of penalty sequences to use (see Feser et al. (2023)):
\itemize{
\item \code{"1"} uses the vMean SGS and gMean gSLOPE sequences.
\item \code{"2"} uses the vMax SGS and gMean gSLOPE sequences.
\item \code{"3"} uses the BH SLOPE and gMean gSLOPE sequences, also known as SGS Original.
}}

\item{groups}{A grouping structure for the input data. Should take the form of a vector of group indices.}

\item{alpha}{The value of \eqn{\alpha}, defines the convex balance between SLOPE and gSLOPE.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{pen_slope_org}{A vector of the variable penalty sequence.}
\item{pen_gslope_org}{A vector of the group penalty sequence.}
}
\description{
Generates variable and group penalties for SGS.
}
\details{
The vMean and vMax SGS sequences are variable sequences derived specifically to give variable false discovery rate (FDR) control for SGS under orthogonal designs (see Feser et al. (2023)).
The BH SLOPE sequence is derived in Bodgan et. al. (2015) and has links to the Benjamini-Hochberg critical values. The sequence provides variable FDR-control for SLOPE under orthogonal designs.
The gMean gSLOPE sequence is derived in Brzyski et. al. (2015) and provides group FDR-control for gSLOPE under orthogonal designs.

\examples{
# specify a grouping structure
groups = c(rep(1:20, each=3),
          rep(21:40, each=4),
          rep(41:60, each=5),
          rep(61:80, each=6),
          rep(81:100, each=7))
# generate sequences
sequences = generate_penalties(gFDR=0.1, vFDR=0.1, pen_method=1, groups=groups, alpha=0.5)
