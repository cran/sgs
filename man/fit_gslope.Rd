\arguments{
\item{X}{Input matrix of dimensions \eqn{n \times p}{n*p}. Can be a sparse matrix (using class \code{"sparseMatrix"} from the \code{Matrix} package).}

\item{y}{Output vector of dimension \eqn{n}. For \code{type="linear"} should be continuous and for \code{type="logistic"} should be a binary variable.}

\item{groups}{A grouping structure for the input data. Should take the form of a vector of group indices.}

\item{type}{The type of regression to perform. Supported values are: \code{"linear"} and \code{"logistic"}.}

\item{lambda}{The regularisation parameter. Defines the level of sparsity in the model. A higher value leads to sparser models:
\itemize{
\item \code{"path"} computes a path of regularisation parameters of length \code{"path_length"}. The path will begin just above the value at which the first predictor enters the model and will terminate at the value determined by \code{"min_frac"}.
\item User-specified single value or sequence. Internal scaling is applied based on the type of standardisation. The returned \code{"lambda"} value will be the original unscaled value(s).
}}

\item{path_length}{The number of \eqn{\lambda} values to fit the model for. If \code{"lambda"} is user-specified, this is ignored.}

\item{min_frac}{Smallest value of \eqn{\lambda} as a fraction of the maximum value. That is, the final \eqn{\lambda} will be \code{"min_frac"} of the first \eqn{\lambda} value.}

\item{gFDR}{Defines the desired group false discovery rate (FDR) level, which determines the shape of the group penalties. Must be between 0 and 1.}

\item{pen_method}{The type of penalty sequences to use (see Brzyski et al. (2019)):
\itemize{
\item \code{"1"} uses the gMean gSLOPE sequence.
\item \code{"2"} uses the gMax gSLOPE sequence.
}}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of ATOS iterations to perform.}

\item{backtracking}{The backtracking parameter, \eqn{\tau}, as defined in Pedregosa and Gidel (2018).}

\item{max_iter_backtracking}{Maximum number of backtracking line search iterations to perform per global iteration.}

\item{tol}{Convergence tolerance for the stopping criteria.}

\item{standardise}{Type of standardisation to perform on \code{X}:
\itemize{
\item \code{"l2"} standardises the input data to have \eqn{\ell_2} norms of one. When using this \code{"lambda"} is scaled internally by \eqn{1/\sqrt{n}}.
\item \code{"l1"} standardises the input data to have \eqn{\ell_1} norms of one. When using this \code{"lambda"} is scaled internally by \eqn{1/n}.
\item \code{"sd"} standardises the input data to have standard deviation of one.
\item \code{"none"} no standardisation applied.
}}

\item{intercept}{Logical flag for whether to fit an intercept.}

\item{screen}{Logical flag for whether to apply screening rules (see Feser and Evangelou (2024)). Screening discards irrelevant groups before fitting, greatly improving speed.}

\item{verbose}{Logical flag for whether to print fitting information.}

\item{w_weights}{Optional vector for the group penalty weights. Overrides the penalties from \code{pen_method} if specified. When entering custom weights, these are multiplied internally by \eqn{\lambda}. To void this behaviour, set \eqn{\lambda = 1}.}

\item{warm_start}{Optional list for implementing warm starts. These values are used as initial values in the fitting algorithm. Need to supply \code{"x"} and \code{"u"} in the form \code{"list(warm_x, warm_u)"}. Not recommended for use with a path or CV fit as start from the null model by design.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{beta}{The fitted values from the regression. Taken to be the more stable fit between \code{x} and \code{z}, which is usually the former. A filter is applied to remove very small values, where ATOS has not been able to shrink exactly to zero. Check this against \code{x} and \code{z}.}
\item{group_effects}{The group values from the regression. Taken by applying the \eqn{\ell_2} norm within each group on \code{beta}.}
\item{selected_var}{A list containing the indicies of the active/selected variables for each \code{"lambda"} value. Index 1 corresponds to the first column in X.}
\item{selected_grp}{A list containing the indicies of the active/selected groups for each \code{"lambda"} value. Index 1 corresponds to the first group in the \code{groups} vector. You can see the group order by running \code{unique(groups)}.}
\item{num_it}{Number of iterations performed. If convergence is not reached, this will be \code{max_iter}.}
\item{success}{Logical flag indicating whether ATOS converged, according to \code{tol}.}
\item{certificate}{Final value of convergence criteria.}
\item{x}{The solution to the original problem (see Pedregosa and Gidel (2018)).}
\item{u}{The solution to the dual problem (see Pedregosa and Gidel (2018)).}
\item{z}{The updated values from applying the first proximal operator (see Pedregosa and Gidel (2018)).}
\item{screen_set}{List of groups that were kept after screening step for each \code{"lambda"} value. (corresponds to \eqn{\mathcal{S}} in Feser and Evangelou (2024)).}
\item{epsilon_set}{List of groups that were used for fitting after screening for each \code{"lambda"} value. (corresponds to \eqn{\mathcal{E}} in Feser and Evangelou (2024)).}
\item{kkt_violations}{List of groups that violated the KKT conditions each \code{"lambda"} value. (corresponds to \eqn{\mathcal{K}} in Feser and Evangelou (2024)).}
\item{pen_gslope}{Vector of the group penalty sequence.}
\item{screen}{Logical flag indicating whether screening was applied.}
\item{type}{Indicates which type of regression was performed.}
\item{intercept}{Logical flag indicating whether an intercept was fit.}

\description{
Group SLOPE (gSLOPE) main fitting function. Supports both linear and logistic regression, both with dense and sparse matrix implementations.
}
\details{
\code{fit_gslope()} fits a gSLOPE model (Brzyski et al. (2019)) using adaptive three operator splitting (ATOS). gSLOPE is a sparse-group method, so that it selects both variables and groups. Unlike group selection approaches, not every variable within a group is set as active.
It solves the convex optimisation problem given by
\deqn{
  \frac{1}{2n} f(b ; y, \mathbf{X}) + \lambda \sum_{g=1}^{m}w_g \sqrt{p_g} \|b^{(g)}\|_2,
}
where the penalty sequences are sorted and \eqn{f(\cdot)} is the loss function. In the case of the linear model, the loss function is given by the mean-squared error loss:
\deqn{
 f(b; y, \mathbf{X}) = \left\|y-\mathbf{X}b \right\|_2^2.
}
In the logistic model, the loss function is given by
\deqn{
f(b;y,\mathbf{X})=-1/n \log(\mathcal{L}(b; y, \mathbf{X})).
}
where the log-likelihood is given by
\deqn{
 \mathcal{L}(b; y, \mathbf{X}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left\{y_i b^\intercal x_i - \log(1+\exp(b^\intercal x_i)) \right\}.
}
The penalty parameters in gSLOPE are sorted so that the largest group effects are matched with the largest penalties, to reduce the group FDR.
The gMean sequence (\code{pen_method=1}) is given by
\deqn{
 w_i^\text{mean} = \overline{F}^{-1}_{\chi_{p_j}} (1-q_gi/m),  \; i = 1,\dots,m,
\text{where} \; \overline{F}_{\chi_{p_j}}(x):= \frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=1}^{m}F_{\chi_{p_j}}(\sqrt{p_j}x),
}
where \eqn{F_{\chi_{p_j}}} is the cumulative distribution function of a \eqn{\chi} distribution with \eqn{p_j} degrees of freedom. The gMax sequence (\code{pen_method=2}) is given by
\deqn{
 w_i^{\text{max}} = \max_{j=1,\ldots,m} \left\{ \frac{1}{\sqrt{p_j}} F^{-1}_{\chi_{p_j}} \left( 1 - \frac{q_g i}{m} \right) \right\},
}
where \eqn{F_{\chi_{p_j}}} is the cumulative distribution function of a \eqn{\chi} distribution with \eqn{p_j} degrees of freedom.
